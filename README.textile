h1. The John Metta Brand

Yeah, it's a bit vain, but I decided to create a brand for myself that was intentional, rather than accidental. You can read about this in my blog post "John Metta: An Intentional Brand":http://positivelyglorious.com/software-media/john-metta-an-intentional-brand. This is just the repository for me to store the icons and other info for my brand.

h2. Font

Optima Heavy, manually skewed horizontally by -17.0 degrees. In Inkscape, this is done at ultra high resolution by creating a document at 2211px X 400px, then creating a standard Optima Heavy textmark of JohnMetta (one word) at 144pt, then increasing the size by 280% (aspect maintained), then skewing the image by -17.0 horizontally.

h2. Logo Artist

Credit where credit is due, this logo was developed by a great graphic artist from Portland, Oregon named "Diego Diaz":http://diegodiaz.com. Check him out if you want some well thought out branding work.
